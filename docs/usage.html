<h1>Usage</h1>

<!-- <p>The CADET pipeline inputs either raw <em>Chandra</em> images with units of counts 
(numbers of captured photons) or normalized processed background-subtracted 
and/or exposure-corrected images. When using flux images for instance, try 
normalizing them by the lowest pixel value so all pixel values are higher 
than or equal to unity. The input image is afterwards automatically scaled 
by a logarithm and normalized by the highest pixel value. Currently only 
128x128 images are supported, however, an improvement that would enable 
arbitrarily sized images is under development (so-far the images were cropped 
and re-binned via ciao_contrib (CIAO 4.13), however, an Astropy version is being developed).
Both the <b><em>CADET_search</em></b> and <b><em>CADET_size</em></b> pipelines 
are composed as self-standing scripts. Discrimination threshold for the <b><em>CADET_search</em></b> 
pipeline was set to 0.9 to suppress false positive detections, while the threshold of the 
<b><em>CADET_size</em></b> pipeline was set to 0.55 so the predicted volumes are not underestimated 
nor overestimated (for more info see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tomasplsek/CADET/blob/main/pdfs/diploma_thesis.pdf">Diploma thesis</a>). 
However, the thresholds of both pipelines are changeable and can be set to an arbitrary value between 0 and 1.
The scripts can be run by simply calling (possibly with a threshold parameter - float from 0 to 1): -->

<p>
The <b><em>CADET</em></b> pipeline inputs either raw <em>Chandra</em> images in units of counts 
(numbers of captured photons) or normalized background-subtracted and/or exposure-corrected images. 
When using e.g. corrected flux images, images should be normalized by the lowest pixel value so all 
pixels are higher than or equal to 1. For images with many point sources, they should be filled 
with surrounding background level using Poisson statistics 
(<a target="_blank" href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmfilth.html">dmfilth</a>
within <a target="_blank" href="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/">CIAO</a>).

Convolutional part of the <b><em>CADET</em></b> pipeline can only input 128x128 images. As a part 
of the pipeline, input images are therefore being cropped to a size specified by parameter scale 
(size = scale * 128 pixels) and re-binned to 128x128 images. By default, images are probed on 4 
different scales (1,2,3,4). The size of the image inputted into the pipeline therefore needs to 
at least 512x512 pixels (minimal input size differs if non-default scales are used) and images 
should be centred at the centre of the galaxy. The re-binning is performed using <em>Astropy</em> and 
<em>Numpy</em> libraries and can only handle integer binsizes. For floating point number binning, we 
recommend using <a target="_blank" href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmregrid.html">dmregrid</a> 
and applying <b><em>CADET</em></b> model manually (see Convolutional part).

<br class="longbr">

Before being decomposed by the DBSCAN algorithm, pixel-wise predictions produced by the convolutional 
part of the <b><em>CADET</em></b> pipeline need to be further thresholded. In order to simultaneously 
calibrate the volume error and false positive rate, we introduced two discrimination thresholds (for 
more info see <a target="_blank" href="">Plšek et al. 2023</a> and their default values are 0.4 and 
0.65, respectively. Nevertheless, both discrimination thresholds are changeable and can be set to an 
arbitrary value between 0 and 1.

The <b><em>CADET</em></b> pipeline is composed as a self-standing Python script (<code>CADET.py</code>), which can 
be run by simply calling it from a terminal using following arguments:
<br class="shortbr">
<code>filename</code> - string, name of the fits file
<br class="shortbr">
<code>scales</code> - list, list of size scales used to crop input images, optional (default: [1,2,3,4])
<br class="shortbr">
<code>threshold1</code> - float, between 0 and 1, calibrates volume error, optional (default: 0.4)
<br class="shortbr">
<code>threshold2</code> - float, between 0 and 1, calibrates false positive rate, optional (default: 0.65)

<b>Example: </b>

<br class="longbr">

<div class="python_code">
<code id="python_code">$ python3 CADET.py NGC5813.fits</code>
<br class="shortbr">
<code id="python_code">$ python3 CADET.py NGC5813.fits [1,2,3,4,5]</code>
<br class="shortbr">
<code id="python_code">$ python3 CADET.py NGC5813.fits [1,2,3,4,5] 0.5 0.9</code>
</div>

<br>

<p>

The script loads a FITS file specified by <code>filename</code> argument located in the 
same folder as the <code>CADET.py</code> script, creates a folder of the same name, 
and saves corresponding pixel-wise as well as decomposed cavity predictions into the FITS 
format while also properly preserving the WCS coordinates. On the output, there is also a 
PNG file showing decomposed predictions for individual scales.

<h2>Convolutional part</h2>

<p>
The convolutional part can be used separately to produce raw pixel-wise predictions. 
Since the convolutional network was implemented using the 
functional <em>Keras</em> API, the architectures together with trained weights could 
have been stored in the HDF5 format (<em>CADET_size.h5</em>, <em>CADET_search.h5</em>). 
The trained models can be simply loaded using the <code>load_model</code> <em>Keras</em> function.
</p>

<div class="python_code">
<code id="python_code">
from keras.models import load_model<br>
<br>
model = load_model("CADET.hdf5")<br>
<br>
y_pred = model.predict(X)
</code>
</div>

<p>
The network inputs 128x128 images. However, to maintain the compatibility with <em>Keras</em>, 
the input needs to be reshaped as <code>X.reshape(1, 128, 128, 1)</code> for single image or as 
<code>X.reshape(len(X), 128, 128, 1)</code> for multiple images.
